            of the HTML that makes up each web page. CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to
            the corresponding elements in your document. A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.</p>
