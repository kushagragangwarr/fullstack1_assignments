    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Frontend Web Development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript portion of website production as opposed
        to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.</p>
